# Milestone 2 Overview

This milestone focuses on setting up the core technical infrastructure (database, backend, frontend, and data science service) and implementing simple baseline models.

The main goal of Milestone 2 is to have an end-to-end skeleton of the system that can be extended in later milestones.

## Objectives

- Create separate services/containers for DB, backend, frontend, and DS.
- Use dedicated branches (`db`, `back`, `front`, `ds`) and pull requests for collaboration.
- Load data from flat files into the database.
- Expose the data via backend CRUD endpoints.
- Build simple baseline models using data accessed through the new infrastructure.
