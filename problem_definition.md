# Problem Definition

For a group project in a **Marketing Analytics** course, **defining a problem and proposing a solution** involves identifying a specific challenge faced by businesses or customers.

The process can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Identify the Problem Area**  
   Choose a broad area of interest within Marketing, such as **Customer Retention**, **Product Development**, **Pricing Strategy**, **Market Segmentation**, or **A/B testing** (you can observe other areas as well).  
   *The intro_to_marketing.pdf slides would help.*

2. **Conduct Preliminary Research**  
   Gather information on current trends, challenges, and opportunities within the chosen area. This can involve reviewing industry reports, academic articles, and market analysis to understand what issues companies or consumers are facing.

3. **Define a Specific Problem**  
   Narrow down the broad area to a specific, measurable problem that can be addressed through Marketing Analytics. This should be a clear, concise statement that outlines what you are trying to solve.  
   *Example:* if the area of interest is customer retention, the specific problem could be identifying factors leading to customer churn in a subscription-based service.

4. **Propose a Solution with Methodology**  
   Outline a solution that utilizes data analytics techniques. This should include:
   - **Data Collection** *(do this after steps 1–3)*: Specify what data will be needed to address the problem (e.g., customer transaction data, survey responses, social media engagement metrics) and how it will be collected.
   - **Analytical Techniques**: Detail the analytical methods or models that will be applied to the data to extract insights.  
     *Example:* for a customer churn problem, this could include survival analysis to predict churn risk or clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior.
   - **Implementation Plan**: Describe how the insights gained from the analysis will be translated into actionable strategies.  
     *Example:* if the analysis identifies key factors influencing churn, the solution could involve targeted interventions for at-risk customers.

5. **Expected Outcomes**  
   Highlight the anticipated benefits of implementing the solution, such as increased customer loyalty, higher revenue, improved product offerings, or more efficient marketing campaigns.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   Define how the success of the solution will be measured. This could include specific KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like retention rate improvements, increase in customer lifetime value, or ROI (Return on Investment) of marketing campaigns.

*Remember, the key to a successful project is not just identifying a problem and solution but also demonstrating how data-driven insights can lead to tangible improvements in marketing strategies and outcomes.*
